You must {verb1} the {adjective1} {noun1}. Then the {noun2} will come to you from the {adjective2} {noun3}.
Once mankind can {verb1} the {adjective1} {noun1}, the age of the {adjective2} {noun2} will arrive.
Be prepared to {verb1} your {adjective1} {noun1}. It will help you {verb2} the {adjective2} {noun2}.
If you {verb1} your {adjective1} {noun1}, you will see the world is just a mirage of the {adjective2} {noun2}.
Learn to {verb1} yourself and you will be able to {verb2} others through the power of the {adjective1} {noun1}.
When you {verb1} the {adjective1} {noun1}, it becomes possible to {verb2} the {adjective2} {noun2}.
Once you {verb1} the {adjective1} {noun1}, nothing will stand between you and the {adjective2} {noun2}.
Enable yourself to {verb1} the {adjective1} {noun1}. Once you achieve this, the {adjective2} {noun2} will guide you towards the {adjective3} {noun3}.
Allow the {adjective1} {noun1} to {verb1} you. This will open your mind to the {adjective2} {noun2}.
Try your best to {verb1} the {adjective1} {noun1}. Therein lies the path to the true {adjective2} {noun2}.
If we look at {scientist}, we understand that our {adjective1} {noun1} is a reflection of the {adjective2} {noun2}. We should {verb1} this {adjective1} {noun1} to achieve the {adjective3} {noun3}.
When you fully {verb1} the {adjective1} {noun1}, you will see {scientist} was wrong about the nature of the {adjective2} {noun2}.
{scientist} was on the path to the {adjective1} {noun1}, but forgot to account for the {adjective2} {noun2}.
Before he was silenced, {scientist} did extensive research on the {adjective1} {noun1}. He found it is possible to {verb1} the {adjective2} {noun2}.
{scientist} was wrong because he does not explain the {adjective1} {noun1}.
Nouns are illusions, there are only verbs. The universe is an activity, not a structure.*
The {adjective1} {noun1} is an illusion, there is only the {adjective2} {noun2}.
The universe comes from the {adjective1} {noun1}, not the {adjective2} {noun2} as {scientist} claimed.
{scientist} can teach us that the {adjective1} {noun1} does not come from the {adjective2} {noun2}, but from the ability to {verb1} the {adjective3} {noun3}.
The {adjective1} {noun1} will guide you towards the {adjective2} {noun2}.
The {adjective1} {noun1} of your {adjective2} {noun2} will {verb1} the {adjective3} {noun3}, allowing you to {verb2} the {adjective4} {noun4}.
{scientist}'s theory is incomplete. It lacks the {adjective1} {noun1} that explains the {adjective2} {noun2}. Without the {adjective1} {noun1}, why is there so much proof of the {adjective3} {noun3}?
If {scientist} says the {adjective1} {noun1} does not exist, then why is it possible to {verb1} the {adjective2} {noun2}?
We contain within ourselves the essence of the {adjective1} {noun1}, as evidenced by phenomena such as the {adjective2} {noun2} which cannot be duplicated by the theories of {scientist}.
The idea to {verb1} the {adjective1} {noun1} for the {adjective2} {noun2} is just a way to {verb2} your {adjective3} {noun3}.
Through recognizing the {adjective1}ness of the {adjective2} {noun1} and the abundance of {noun2} in the {adjective3} {noun3} we inhabit, one can {verb2} the {adjective4} {noun4}.
By precise placement of the {adjective1} {noun1} to {verb1} the {adjective2} {noun2}, the {adjective3} {noun3} will {verb2} the {noun4} from the {adjective4} {noun5}.
What if the {adjective1} {noun1} is not inherent to the {adjective2} {noun2}? Instead, they could both {verb1} the {adjective3} {noun3} from the {adjective4} {noun4}.
Shall the {noun1} be {adjective1}, one could {verb1} the {adjective2} {noun2} of the {adjective3} {noun3}.
Combining the {adjective1} {noun1} with the {adjective2} {noun2} will allow us to {verb1} the new {adjective3} {noun3}, leading to the {adjective4} {noun4} of the {adjective5} {noun5}.
The public has forgotten that in his later years, {scientist} changed his mind about the {adjective1} {noun1}. He realised how to {verb1} the {adjective2} {noun2}.
There is no evidence that the {adjective1} {noun1} is not {adjective2}, making it obvious that one can {verb2} the {adjective3} {noun2}, allowing us to {verb3} the {adjective4} {noun3} until it becomes {adjective5}.
The theories of {scientist} postulate that the {adjective1} {noun1} will cause {noun2} to reach the level of the {adjective3} {noun3}.
With the insights gained by {scientist}, we plainly see that the {adjective1} {noun1} is nothing more than a trivial example of the {adjective2} {noun2}. It is now an integral part of {adjective2} theory.
Advances in the field of {scientist}ian {adjective1} dynamics show that the {adjective2} {noun1} can, under the right circumstances, {verb1} the {adjective3} {noun2}.
To fully understand the {adjective1} {noun1}, it is imperative to consider the implications of the {scientist}ian {adjective2} {noun2}.
The {adjective1} {noun1} cannot be fully explained by the {adjective2} {noun2} as {scientist} claims. There is still the unsolved mystery of the {adjective3} {noun3}.
Do not be tempted by the {adjective1} {noun1}. Only the {adjective2} {noun2} can {verb1} the {adjective3} {noun3}.
